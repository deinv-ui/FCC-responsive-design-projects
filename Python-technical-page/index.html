          <h2>Python Introduction</h2>
          </header>
        <p>
          What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>It is used for:
          </p>
        <ul>
         <li>web development (server-side),</li>
           <li>software development,</li>
           <li>mathematics,</li>
           <li>system scripting.</li>
          </ul>
           
  <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
              <ul>
         <li>used on a server to create web applications.</li>
           <li>used alongside software to create workflows.
</li>
           <li>connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
           <li>used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
           <li>used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
           <ul>
         <li>works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
           <li> has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
</li>
           <li> has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
           <li>runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
           <li>can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Python Getting Started</h2>
          </header>
        <h3>Python Install</h3>
        <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
        </p>

<code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
        
<p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
  </p>

        <code>python --version</code>

        <p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website:<a alt="python.org" href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
</p>       
        
        <h3>Python Quickstart</h3>
         <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
<br>
The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
        </p>

<code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --versionC:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
        
<p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
  </p>

        <code>helloworld.py

print("Hello, World!")</code>

        <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
</p>      
        
        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
        
        <p>The output should read:</p>
        
        <code>Hello, World!</code>
        
        <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.

          <h2>Python Syntax</h2>
          </header>
        <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
        <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
         <br> Example:</p>
       

        <code>if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
        
        <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
        
        <code>Syntax Error:
          if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
</code>
        
        <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

Example</p>
        
        <code>if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") </code>
      
        <h3>Python Variables</h3>
        <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Example
Variables in Python:</p>
        
        <code>x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"</code>
        
       <p> Python has no command for declaring a variable.

You will learn more about variables in the <a href="#Python_Variables">Python Variables</a> chapter.</p>
     </section>   
         
     
     	 <section class = "main-section" id ="Python_Comments">
        <header>
          <h2>Python Comments</h2>
          </header>
         <ul>
           <li>explain Python code.</li>
           <li>make the code more readable.</li>
           <li>prevent execution when testing code.</li>
         
           </ul>
         
         <h3>Creating a Comment</h3>
         <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
         <code>#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")</code>
         
         <p>Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:</p>
         
         <code>print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
</code>
         <p>
           Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
         </p>
         
          <code>#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
</code>
         
         <h3>Multi Line Comments</h3>
         <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:</p>
         
         <code>#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")</code>
         
        <p> Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:</p>
         
         <code>"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")</code>

          <h2>Python Variables</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>Creating Variables</h3>
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
       
       <code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code>
       
       <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
       <code>x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)</code>
       
       <p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
       <code>x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'</code>
       
       <h3>Variable Names</h3>
        <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
       
         <ul>
           <li>must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
           <li>cannot start with a number</li>
           <li> can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
           <li>case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
         
           </ul>

          </header>
          <h3>Built-in Data Types</h3>
          <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

<pre>            
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

        <header>
          <h2>Python Numbers</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>Python Numbers</h3>
           <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>int</li>
           <li>float</li>
           <li>complex</li>
           </ul>  
         
         <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
         
         <code>x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex</code>
         
         <p>To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:</p>
         <code>print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))</code>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Casting">
        <header>
          <h2>Python Casting</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>Specify a Variable Type</h3>
           <p>There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by rounding down to the previous whole number), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)</li>
           <li>float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)</li>
           <li>str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals</li>
           </ul>  
           
           
           <p>Integers:</p>
           <code>x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3</code>
           
            <p>Float:</p>
           <code>x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2
</code>
           
            <p>Strings:</p>
           <code>x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'</code>

        <header>
          <h2>Python Strings</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>String Literals</h3>
           <p>String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:</p>
     
          <code>print("Hello")
print('Hello')</code>
      
          <h3>Assign String to a Variable</h3>
            <p>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:</p>

          <code>a = "Hello"
print(a)</code>

           <h3>Multiline Strings</h3>
            <p>You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:</p>
            <p>You can use three double quotes:</p>
            <code>a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)</code>
     
            <p>Or three single quotes:</p>
             <code>a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)</code>

          <h2>Python Booleans</h2>
          </header>
          <strong>Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.</strong>
          <h3>Boolean Values</h3>
           <p>In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:</p>
          <code>print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)
</code>
            
          <p>When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:</p>
            <code>a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")</code>

          </header>
           <p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
              <li>Assignment operators</li>

              <li>Membership operators</li>
              <li>Bitwise operators</li>
              </ul>
       
       <h3>Python Arithmetic Operators</h3>
